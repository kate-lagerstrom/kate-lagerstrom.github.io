title: "The under-investigated wild side of <i>Escherichia coli</i>: Genetic diversity, pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance in wild animals"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-04-14_underinvestigated_wild_side
excerpt: 'This literature review covers the small body of work on <i>E. coli</i> in wild animals to-date. In highlighting the geographic range and host taxonomic coverage of these studies, it identifies significant gaps in each. The current understanding of <i>E. coli</i> in wild animals is summarized, including its genetic diversity, host and geographic distribution, and transmission pathways within and between wild animal and human populations.'

We assess the current understanding of <i>E. coli</i> in wild animals through a scoping literature review encompassing the body of work on <i>E. coli</i> in wild animal hosts comprising just 93 studies after explicitly excluding those considering domesticated animals, pets, livestock and captive zoo animals, which have been more studied for pathogenic <i>E. coli</i>. We identify three major gaps: (i) within the existing studies themselves (ii) in the geographic locations of studies to date and (iii) in the wild animal host species investigated. Addressing these gaps will prove essential for global human health and the preservation of many ecosystem services of high economic value.
