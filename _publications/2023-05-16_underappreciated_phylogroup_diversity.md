title: "Under-appreciated phylogroup diversity of <i>Escherichia coli</i> within and between animals at the urban-wildland interface"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-05-16_underappreciated_phylogroup_diversity
excerpt: 'We sample more <i>E. coli</i> isolates per individual wild animal among an interacting multispecies community imbedded in a human-dominated landscape than ever before, and in turn, uncover the globally known phylogroup diversity in a single geographic location. We also identify antimicrobial-resistant and pathogenic strains, as well as potential instances of transmission within the wild community and across the wildland-urban interface.'

<i>E. coli</i> is <i>usually</i> good for you! Is it good for animals, too? We donâ€™t really know, but they certainly carry it! And as we show here, a much greater diversity of it than we so far appreciate. But why? It has likely existed in wild animals for a long time, but I suspect that an ever-increasing human population, and resulting extensive environmental pollution by our waste combined with various antimicrobial agents, has already impacted environmental and wild animal gut bacteria at large. We reason that due to extensive anthropogenic environmental contamination, wildlife is increasingly exposed to our waste, including <i>E. coli</i> and antibiotics. The gaps in the ecological and evolutionary understanding of <i>E. coli</i> thus necessitate a significant uptick in research to better understand human impacts on wildlife and the risk for zoonotic pathogen emergence. Thus, the already famous model organism, <i>E. coli</i>, might just be ideally suited to serve as a model for understanding the ecology and evolution of microbes at the human-wildlife interface in the Anthropocene.
