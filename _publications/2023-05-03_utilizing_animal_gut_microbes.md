Microbial communities inhabiting animal gastrointestinal tracts play crucial roles in maintaining global biodiversity by contributing to the health of their hosts. Ongoing biodiversity conservation efforts must consider associated gut microbial communities because they are integral to animal survival. Scientists, governing entities, and conservation practitioners must work together to protect and leverage gut microbial diversity to improve wild animal health. Efforts to increase knowledge about, and protection for, animal microbiomes will aid in combating global biodiversity loss.
