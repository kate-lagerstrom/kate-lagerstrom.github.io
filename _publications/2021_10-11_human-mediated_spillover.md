Human-mediated impacts to Earthâ€™s ecosystems have consequences for both ecosystem and human health. In the past and still today, efforts to preserve or "restore" biodiversity are sometimes antagonistic to human interests. In this review, our team outlines ways that we can work toward general principles to guide future research and more effectively integrate the related goals of biodiversity conservation and spillover prevention. We conclude by summarizing how these principles could be used to integrate the goal of spillover prevention into ongoing biodiversity conservation initiatives.
